* Transcript (in progress)

Sacha: Hello and welcome to another episode of Emacs Chat.  Today we have Xah Lee from http://ergoemacs.org and he'll tell us lots of interesting things about, custom keyboards and keybindings and publishing with emacs, and so forth.  Xah, Hello and thank you so much for joining us, and thank you as well for all the work you've been working on for emacs. Before I dive into this whole emacs thing, tell us a bit about your life outside of emacs: what are you interested in?

Xah: Okay, I'm a big nerd so I'm interested in math, I want to be great in math.  Basically math and programming, and that's about it.

Sacha: Cool. I was looking through your config earlier, and it does have lambda symbols and epsilons and all that stuff, so it would be great to hear more about you [talking over each other 00:54]

Xah: Yeah, unicode, I love those math symbols, yes.

Sacha: So, [coming back to] Emacs.  You've been using Emacs for a really long time, I think.  I rememeber running into you when I was starting Emacs, years and years ago.  What got you interested in Emacs in the first place?

Xah: That's an interesting question.  I remember you in 2006, that's the first time I saw you, I don't know if you remember but I saw you on IRC.

Sacha: Yeah, I remember that.

Xah: I got into Emacs around 1998.  That's when I started to do web dev, I started to learn perl actually, perl and unix stuff.  I got into emacs because of unix; they are kind of together because emacs is usually on unix.  It's just fascinating because I'm interested in the history of computing, so unix is a big, big  player there.  I just read about [Emacs] in unix history, and also Lisp history.  I remember there was an O'Reilly book on Emacs, and especially, Free Software. {Should it be: "and, especially" or ", and especially"?} Well Emacs and GNU, the gnu head (the animal).  So I thought, "What kind of strange thing is that?", y'know, and I looked in the preface, and lots of places they have GPL manifesto of the Free Software foundation.  I thought, "Hmm, this is odd, I don't know what that is".  So eventually I learnt Unix, and I worked in the web dev ecommerce field, so I started to use Emacs [around] 1998 almost {? 02:38}

Sacha: That's a long time ago.

Xah: Yeah, that was the dot-com days: the good old days.

Sacha: What's kept you interested in emacs all this time; I can't even do the math any more. What have you liked about it?

Xah: I guess the geekiness is part of it.  It's got the entire documentation, well they call it the self-documenting... well I'll have to look at the Emacs manual ["the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor"].  So, I began by reading the tutorial in Emacs C-h t, like everyone else.  I would just flow through and read everything, oh and one important thing about Emacs is that I love it because it's Lisp.  I have programmed in mathematica[?] before and I'm interested in artificial intelligence and all that computer science stuff.  I heard about Lisp [since] it's heavily associated with artificial intelligence, but it's in emacs!  So that's why I had a strong attraction [to Emacs], I started learning Emacs and I wanted to learn it really well.

Sacha: You've customized Emacs quite thoroughly, so for example with ErgoEmacs, what got you interested in changing all the keybindings and really changing how emacs works for you?

Xah: I started customizing, only four or five years ago. The first five years of emacs I pretty much didn't do any customization at all, yeah that's strange I know.  I also didn't even know lisp, I started to learn a little bit of lisp from 2006, but before that 1998 to 2006 was pretty much all in terminals and I followed everything by the defaulth keys.  For the keybinding I think I started because, back in early 1994 I started using Dvorak, I know you also use Dvorak.  You type so fast!  Like 117 wpm, or something like that, I read.  My best speed on qwerty back then was only around 90 wpm.

Sacha: Which is pretty good, you know, a lot of people would love to be able to type at 90 wpm.  If that's how fast you were on qwerty, how fast are you now in Dvorak? 

Xah: Oh, my dvorak is not very fast. The last time I tested, maybe 90 would be the maximum, if I wanted to go beyond 90 I would have to practice for a month or so.

Sacha: When it comes to programming the bottleneck is not really typing speed, it's how fast you think, and I'm very slow at that. *laughs*

Okay, so you changed keyboard layout but then you still continued to use Emacs with very little customization for eight years and then what got you interested in learning lisp and customizing it further?

Xah: Around 2006 I discovered IRC, I know it's much older than that but I didn't use it until 2006, I joined #emacs IRC group.  There are a huge amount of things I don't know.  When went onto #emacs IRC I was thinking, I know all these things, I've been using Emacs for five years but they are just constantly saying things that [make me think] "Oh, I didn't know that and that is useful", so that got me started learning lisp, [] this is something useful you can do this way so I started to put in my [init?] 

Sacha: [So you were] seeing other people's questions or talking about the functions that people are using.  How do you go from borrowing small snippets of other people's config to writing a whole lot of customizations to really change things around?

Xah: I guess theat happens gradually.  Before I thought, "I don't want to put stuff in my init[?]", you get into this emacs mindset, it's like a black whole: you're going to spend all your life in it.  I know I've read people they customize emwacs this and that, but I was thinking "I'm not going to do that, this works for me, plain emacs is just fine", but beginning 2006 I started to do that [(customize)].  So it was gradual, it began with writing notes, I started my emacs blog about that time too.  I wanted to write a lot of math symbols, unicode, unicode was not that popular at that time but you have to work out how to get emacs to display that many symbols.  So I did that and I posted it on the web, small notes began that way and it jsut grew larger.

Sacha: Your blog, how does your blog work?  I think it's just html?

Xah: Yeah, I write raw html, back in the 1990s I used MS Word, but I decided to just write raw html and then with emacs I still start by typing in raw html then theres the html mod that's default basic mod, so there are some commands there for inserting various tags, so I used that very well but gradually I found it inadequate, I wanted to add some other tags it doesn't have, the unicode for that is pretty simple so i started to write that.  Then it just grew, I wanted to have it so I could just press a key and delete a tag or find a nested tag and it just grew.

Sacha: You've written hundreds and hundreds of pages about emacs so it's quite interesting to go to your archive.

Xah: Thank you.  It's a habit. *laughs* I got sucked into emacs.

Sacha: You're constantly learning about emacs, what are some of the resources you use to learn more?  Where do you find all these interesting things that you write about

Xah:  In the past few years I haven't really read much about other peoples work, but before that I was in the IRC and Irc is very helpful but there are other resources like Emacs Wiki, that was very helpful, and the emacs manual.  The other important resource for me was newscoops[?], gnu.emacs.help I think, and before that comp.emacs, so I spent a lot of time there, and also arguing about emacs stuff.

Sacha: Yeah your quite a contreversial person in the emacs community. *laugh*

Xah: I know. *laugh* I am sorry.

Sacha: No, no, it's good for some people to have strong opinions about things because then everyone gets to think about that, and one of those controversial things that people are curious about is changing all these keybindings and changing how emacs works.  But before we dive into that I was curious abmout the custom keyboards that youve also been playing around with.

Xah: Yes, I was meaning to show you that.  I am using this keyboard <holds up keyboard to camera>, it's called, Truly Ergonomic Keyboard. it has mechanical keys, they use cherry mx brown.  It's totally symmetric.  This is the new one, the one I have <points camera to a similar keyboard on Xah's desktop> that's the one I'm using. I have a video on youtube you can look at where I ntroduce this keyboard.  In the past three years I've had some problems with RSI so I looked around and try to find out about keyboards, what's good and bad, and tried to improve the situation.  I got this free actually, and I love it.  There's also kinesis[?] and moltron[?] and this recently there's ergodocs[?], those are great. I like symmetric ones, I used microsoft 4000 or microsoft natural before.

Sacha: There's certainly a lot of innovation going on in keyboard design too.  It's great to see people coming up with different designs and trying them.  I see you are taking advantage of all these differt keys in your keyboard bindings, the new meta [blah?] keys.

Xah: It would be great if I could... is there a package where I type something it shows on the side what keys you type?  I know there's one they use in vim golf.

Sacha: I haven't actually looked up one for showing the keystrokes yet, I'm sure someone must have written one.

Xah: In lots of emacs tutorial videos they use that, they show the keystrokes.

Sacha: I'm going to look at list-packages.  By the way, if anyone listening knows the name of this package you can use the q and a to tell us which package that is.

Xah: I installed it for a while, I think it's vim [[what?]].  I know who knows, Phillips, and maybe one of the... you might have interviewed him before, they are all emacs gods.

Sacha: You mentioned that you had some interesting things to show us.

Xah: I know you were going to ask about init files so 

Sacha: [blah 14:54] very large ones so I guess we don't have to walk through the entire thing. I went through it this afternoon and I was stealing little bits for my own config. What are some particularly interesting ways you've customized emacs to fit you?

Xah: I have somme things here that I prepared to show you, if we can share screens.

Sacha: [explains how to share screens in google chat] Okay I can see your screen, perfect!

Xah: Great.  I want to show you.. most of the time today [[distortion ]] emacs chat with sacha.  

Sacha: Can we maximize this and change the font scale?

Xah: Is this good?  I spend spend a lot of time writing blogs.  This is my emacs blogs[?]

Sacha: Is this your todo list as well?

Xah: Yeah, kind of, I commented that out: it's for tomorrow, and the next day, about my emacs blog.  So let's select down and uncomment it.  In any case, I want to show you these commands.  Say I want to capitalise this <highlights a title> and I call this command <title becomes capitalised>.  Notice that "for" is not capitalised, it capitalises for a title: "for" is not capitalised [in titles], "of" and so on.  Okay so this one... so I press the key... so that command is xah-remove-html-tag {checkit}, so I just removed html tags there and I press another key to make a list out of it and that is "that", lines-to-html-list {checkit}. Stop me or ask me any questions because othewise I'm going to go into a monologue.

Sacha: No, no, I think it's really interesting how you've come up with little functions that transform the text, I've been using M-c to change the case ^sentence case of a string^ but had to go and fix "for" and all these other things, that's great.  And obiously the way you've rebound TAB-Backspace to do something interesting, that's cool too.

Xah: How do you know?  How did you know I used TAB-Backspace?

Sacha: When you did describe-function {checkit} it shows the keybindings.

Xah: Ooooookay, okay, right.  

{Xah is typing and something interesting is happening on screen}

Sacha: Yeah, okay, so you can cycle through the different ways of {formatting the lines??}

Xah: That is "that" {I am going to have to describe all these "this" and "that" or it will be boggling.} Most of these commands are also in Ergo Emacs, I've used it for several years.  David Capello {checkit}, who joined in contributing that code, he made a huge amount of contributions; before it was just a set of global keybindings, it was not a major mod at all.  Then David Capello made it into a robust major mod.  Then last year, about January, Matthew took over, and he added a tonne of things.  So it's really fantastic now.  Unfortunately though, this keyboard doesn't have big Alt keys on both sides so I stopped using the mod; I started to use my own, for this keyboard.

Sacha: Yes, it's funny how the keyboard really influences how we work.  Cristian Kru.. Klu.. Klerj.. one of our viewers says, "relating to dvorak and the Truly keyboard, the third layer of the neo {checkit} layout is really good for programming.", so more layouts, and more code.  Anyway, so back to emacs.

Xah: Where was he, on IRC or something?

Sacha: Oh, people can use the Q&A app to ask questions, I keep an on that and I'll bring their questions up when I see them.

Xah: If I click on that it will show?

Sacha: Not any more, because I've just marked the question as answered, but yes that's where it would show up.

Xah: {reading his notes} What does that mean?  I don't know? *laughs* I write a lot of my own commands, but a lot of these are in other packages, or part of emacs.  Whenever you recognize something, mention it, and remind me.  Clean-white-space is one of those, it just deletes all the double blank lines.  Emacs has a similar... This is my init, it is on github.  Oh, this one is cool!  I go to an image directory: so this is all images, okay this is my truly ergonomic layout {image of xah's keyboard} so that's an image.  If I want to scale it, I press a key and call start-direct-scale-image {checkit}, let's say 50%, let's say 20% thumbnail, sharpen, yes.  Okay, success!  Success!  Now I call dired jump to go to the file location, and I refresh and you can see it's this one.

Sacha: So it calls image magic or something like that behind the scenes.

Xah: Yes.  It basically just calls the shell command image-magic.  I have all this in a tutorial format on my website; if you just search "dired scale image" on http://ergoemacs.org I think you'll find it.

Sacha: It must come in really handy when you're putting in screen shots to your blog.

Xah: Yeah that's right, I do that all the time. This one, I don't know if you have seen it, probably, I mean all these aren't my files I'm just mix.. {not heard} into them.  Here is Richard Stallman and Julian Assange, have you seen this?

Sacha: No.

Xah: This is from last year, so I guess Richard Stallman went to the UK to meet him, so they took a photo together.  That's the kind of thing I might need to make a scaled version of, or whatever, so I created those commands.

Sacha: And then you use SCP or something like that to copy it over?

Xah: SCP?

Sacha: Sorry, SSH or R-sync to copy the files over?

Xah: Yes.  This is my emacs blog, right? So I write it, I can press a key to preview it, so right now it's garbage, so let's say I want to write this, use this... fantastic!  {things happening on screen} 

Sacha: I was looking at your config and I saw how you have some code to translate the corner brackets into mark-up, and I was wondering because your mwebpages alwayps have the control and x and all those things are individually marked up.

Xah: Yeah. I want to show you that.  So, for example, let's say the key is C-x f whatever that is, I want to press that so that key is.. "that"

Sacha: So you just insert the unicode characters into it and you use all these keybindings to make it easier to wrap the text.

Xah: Yes, for example this one I want to press another key, this becomes formatted into code.  I started to use unicode in my command names.

Sacha: You have all these conversion functions that actually have arrows in their names.

Xah: Yeah.  So, I press another key and this key gets turned into what you would see on my emacs blog. {things happennig on screen} Let's view in browser, and it became this nicely formatted thing.

Sacha: I was wondering how you did that, basically when I'm writing my posts I use org mode so I use the equals sign a lot, to say, "okay this part here is going to show up in a fixed-width font, but you have so much more distinction between the different posts because you're using unicode when you write it, and then you bind{?} it to specific tags.

Xah: Yeah, I try to use unicode.  Most of these are not that consistent, like a system.  I just built them one by one over the years, and I keep changing them.

Sacha: That's actually something I'm curious about, because a lot of people also, we build our config up one by one but it's hard to keep it all organised.  I see that you've actually split up your config into  multiple files, and you've worked on having a consistent keybinding approach to it.

Xah: Yeah, my config, mostly I'm the only one who uses it, so I change keybindings almost every week.

Sacha: Really?  Wow!

Xah: I have to think about if something is 0.0001% more efficient, then I must change to that.

Sacha: I have a hard time remembering the keybindings I set.  I'm trying to use M-SPC for ace-jump-mode and it's still hard to get used to it and thats only one key binding and you're changing a lot more.

Xah: I almost use none of the default keybindings.  The only one I use is the four arrow keys and F1 and C-h, that's about it; okay also Page Up and Page Down, everything else is my own choice.

Sacha: So how do you practice using the keys for things you use less frequently, and what happens when you sit down to use somebody else's emacs?

Xah: Oh I freeze, like I don't know what to do.  If you take out my keybindings it's like I'm starting to use wordpad.  So, you have to give me ten or fifteen minutes to set up my keybindings.  I don't know how that would work out if you were working in a company.
